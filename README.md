# Huffman-Encoding

By Jose Juan Velasquez, Amelia Matheson and Bryan Le

Run HuffmanMain.java to use this program. You will be prompted to type in a string to be encoded. When you are finished typing, press ENTER and your string will be processed by the program. The encoding binary codes for each character in your string will be printed on the console, followed by the full encoded binary string for the original input string. Finally, the original input string is printed to the console; this is done by decoding the encoded string.
